                                    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                                    <p>Belife was created in 2019, by Haneul and her friends in elementary school with a different name, eco club. <br />
                                        Belife started from climate change action, campaigning about climate change impact to animals in school, local community (Gwanggyo Well-Being Town), subway stations, etc. <br />
                                        Entering middle school, Belife concentrated more on education. With elementary and middle school students, Haneul made an online weekly meeting sharing helpful information about pets, with her certificate of Animal Trainer. <br />
                                        After moving to Pickering College, </p>

                                    <p>Belife expanded to advocate for global animal welfare, dealing with various animal welfare issues that need people’s attention. <br />
                                        Our goal is to not only advocate for the pet animals, but also numerous worldwide animal cruelty problems in fields of lab animals, farm animals, and wildlives. <br />
                                        We’ve been starting our acts from climate change/environmental problems and the influence to the animals on World Vegan Day in Pickering College, <br />
                                        further expanding our actions towards various range of animal cruelty problems worldwide, influencing further our community. </p>

                                        <p>Starting as Eco club, we campaigned in various locations: school, local apartments and subway station. <br />
                                            This photo was taken when eco club had a school campaign with young Grade 2,3 students who wanted to advocate for the animals. <br />
                                            Each students made their pickets in home, and bring it to school to campaign together. <br />
                                            but <strong>Campaigning</strong> was Belife's first step to send our message to the public. <br />
                                            </p>

                                            <p> 
                                                In other eco club activities, as a group or individual, we made our pickets with different styles. Some illustrated a polar bear, some prepared a quiz, and some wrote cartoons.
                                                Our purpose was to communicate with the public, and to see how public look at us. We were all nervous, felt strange, but all of our members felt proud of themselves for standing out for climate change. <br />
                                                Furthermore, we expanded our target to local residents. Local residents gave a thumbs up for these young children standing out for the environment, even a local reporter interviewed us! <br />
                                                Belife in 2018 was first step of environmental awareness in our local community. </p>

                                        <p>Haneul expanded this club with a more formal name Econimal in middle school. Econimal recruited people all around Suwon, managed with two adults.<br />
                                            With more focused on speech lessons and animal protection near us, such as birds, dogs and cats, hamsters,etc. Econimal was a more <br />

                                            Econimal was a learning opportunity for young students to stand out, and was a big experience to Haneul; She learned how to mediate conflicts <br />
                                            arising from conflicting interests. Also, Econimal was the first opportunity to consider deeper about being a leader, as we expanded our acitivities.<br/>
                                            Through various trials, Haneul learned leader who communicates and who prioritizes members than one's idea and direction is the pursuit of a leader <br/> </p>
